# Simon Game

## Project Overview
The **Simon Game** is a web-based memory game inspired by the classic Simon game. It challenges users to remember and replicate sequences of colors and sounds, with increasing difficulty at each level.

## Features
- **Dynamic Color and Sound Feedback:** Engaging user experience with visual and auditory cues.
- **Random Pattern Generation:** Each round introduces a new, randomly generated sequence.
- **User Input Validation:** Compares user inputs against the sequence to determine if the player advances.
- **Game Over & Reset Mechanism:** Detects mistakes and provides options to restart the game.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for smooth gameplay across multiple devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**

## How to Play
1. The game starts with one color flashing, and the user must click the corresponding button.
2. Each subsequent round adds a new color to the sequence.
3. The user must repeat the growing sequence in the correct order.
4. The game continues until the player makes a mistake, at which point the game ends and can be reset.

## Future Enhancements
- Add difficulty levels (e.g., increase the speed of color flashes as the user progresses).
- Include a scoring system to track high scores.
- Multiplayer mode for head-to-head competition.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
